## Algothon 2025
Team Name: Lean Mean Algo Trading Machine

### Situation
Participated in the UNSW x Susquehana Algothon 2025. The objectives, instructions, and scoring criteria is outlined [here](./algothon-objectives.md).

### Task/Problem 
We were tasked to develop a computer program that places trades on syntehtic data.

### Action
For the general round, we submitted a simple turtle trading strategy. This was enough to get us into the finals. For the final round, we implemented a strategy that takes the first and second derivatives of the exponential moving averages across a 10-day period of previous price data and traded based on direction and momentum.

### Result
Finalists :)
